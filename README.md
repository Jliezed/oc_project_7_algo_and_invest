<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Project Overview
### Goal:
- Design an algorithm that will maximize the profit made by our clients after two years of investment. Your algorithm should suggest a list of the most profitable stocks we should buy to maximize a client's profit after two years.

### We have the following constraints:
- Each share can only be purchased once.
- We cannot buy a fractional share.
- We can spend a maximum of 500 euros per customer. 

### Datasets:
- data.csv: list of 20 stocks
- data2.csv: list of 1000 stocks
- data3.csv: list of 1000 stocks

* Python
* Itertools
* Pandas
* Timeit
* Guppy

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Jliezed/oc_project_7_algo_and_invest.git
   ```

### Run the script with a virtual environment:

Install venv library (if not yet in your computer)

   ```sh
   pip install venv
   ```

Create a virtual environment

   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   ```

Activate the virtual environment

   ```sh
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

Install packages using requirements.txt

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Run a script

   ```sh
   python bruteforce.py
   python optimized_dynamic_programming.py
   python optimized_glouton.py
   ```

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Results
### Bruteforce algorithm
- Bruteforce algorithm tests all the possible combinations of stocks to buy. 
- The algorithm is very slow and does not allow to test the 1000 stocks dataset.
- Big O:
  - Time complexity: O(n!)
  - Space complexity: O(n!)

### Greedy algorithm
- Greedy algorithm involves making locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum solution.
- It is a simple algorithm that does not guarantee the best result. 
- The algorithm is very fast and allows to test the 1000 stocks dataset.
- Big O:
  - Time complexity: O(n)
  - Space complexity: O(1)

### Dynamic programming algorithm (based on Knapsack)
- Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems
- Solving each subproblem only once, and storing the results for future use. 
- It is a complex algorithm that guarantees the best result.
- The algorithm is very fast and allows to test the 1000 stocks dataset and more.
- Big O:
  - Time complexity: O(nU)
  - Space complexity: O(1)
